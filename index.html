            <p>Hello, my name is Eshban YOunis. I am a passionate and motivated student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at BYU Pathways Worldwide. Ever since I was young, I have not been interested in computer science. But when I was finished my highschool my dad shared to me about technology and it's benefits for me in future then i decided to take course to learn more about technology what is this and how it works what is computer languages and what is front-end what is back-end. Then my journey in the field of computer science began with my curiosity about how computers work and has since evolved into a deep interest in software development and web development.

                Outside of the classroom, I actively participate in coding competitions and hackathons, where I enjoy collaborating with fellow students to tackle real-world challenges and develop innovative solutions. Looking ahead, I am eager to continue my journey in computer science and I am committed to making a positive impact and shaping the future of the digital world.</p>
